# perfect-pesto
My husband makes this delicious pesto - seriously, it's fantastic. 
He's gotten the recipe fine-tuned to the point that we have ratios of every ingredient to the amount of basil available (he grows his own basil). 
As I've been learning to code, I thought a great early project would be to build a "pesto calculator," where the user inputs the amount of basil they have, and gets back the perfect recipe for the best pesto ever.

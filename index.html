    <p>Make the perfect pesto! For the perfect ratios, you'll need a digital kitchen scale that can measure in grams. We
        like to make our pesto in a food processor, but you can also use a mortar and pestle if preferred.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <!-- The spans below contain the amount in grams (or mLs) of each ingredient. These will be changed upon submitting the form. -->
            <li>Your <span class="basil-grams">70</span> <span class="unit-txt">grams</span> of basil</li>
            <li><span class="pasta">252</span> <span class="unit-txt">grams</span> of short pasta, such as penne</li>
            <li><span class="cheese">42</span> <span class="unit-txt">grams</span> of Parmigiano Reggiano, Grana Padano, or similar</li>
            <li><span class="nuts">42</span> <span class="unit-txt">grams</span> of nuts (we prefer walnuts, but pine nuts are the classic nut for
                pesto</li>
            <li><span class="oil">130.9</span> milliliters of oil</li>
            <li>Lots of garlic (follow your heart!). We like minced garlic in oil, but you can use fresh garlic if
                preferred.</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- The directions are standard and won't change. -->
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil a medium saucepot of water and cook the pasta one minute less than the package direction, or until
                al dente. Reserve a ladle-full of pasta water in a small bowl, then drain your pasta.</li>
            <li>While the water is boiling and pasta is cooking, take out your food processor.</li>
            <li>Add your basil, cheese, nuts, oil, garlic, and salt to the food processor. Pulse until mostly smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Adjust salt and/or garlic to taste.</li>
            <li>Transfer your pesto to a large bowl. Stir in pasta water, a little at a time, until you get a nice sauce
                consistency.</li>
            <li>Add your pasta and stir.</li>
            <li>Serve with freshly ground black pepper, a sprinkle of finishing salt, and/or a bit extra grated cheese,
                to your taste.</li>
            <li>Devour.</li>
        </ol>
